<h1>Application server</h1>

This portfolio includes and application server linked to my existing web infrastructure already serving web pages via Nginx that i installed in my first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server, therefore,this project adds a dedicated application server to my infrastructure, pluged to my Nginx and is used to serve an Airbnb clone project.
